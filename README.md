Tiketo is a lightweight, Tkinter-based ticket management system designed for local use. It allows users to create, list,and delete tickets while sending
email notifications automatically through Outlook or Gmail, depending on the config.py file. 

ðŸ”§ How It Works

Tickets are saved in JSON locally and sent to the recipients/admins email
Each ticket has a UUID, title, description, and status (open).

ðŸš€ Getting Started
